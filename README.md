# Bayesian Statistics
This repository contain Bayesians statistics implementation in R and Python. The directories available are:

* DPMM: contains the R code to implement Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (DPMM) using `NIMBLE` on the `iris` dataset. The primary referece to understand the theory behind DPMMs are the [Bayesian non-parametric tutorials](https://tamarabroderick.com/tutorial_2017_simons.html) by Tamara Broderick.
* Nimble: Understanding `NIMBLE` syntax using a simple bayesian capture-recapture model example taken from the [`NIMBLE` tutorial](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/banana-book/intronimble.html) by Olivier Gimenez.
