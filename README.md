# Bayesian Statistics
Repository will contain MCMC practice, references for Bayesian parametric and Bayesian non-parametric methods. R codes to implements these methods will be available as well.

### Theory
1. Lecture videos by Prof. Jarad Niemi available on YouTube were the most helpful to get started with MCMC basics. The lectures that I found particularly useful to understand MCMC are:
    * [Monte Carlo Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKnjsqYVG4Y)
    * [Inverse CDF method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TR0biDues7k)
    * [Accept-Reject Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoNGH5PkXDQ)
    * [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGRVRjr0vyw)
    * [Metropolis within Gibbs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJjcBwRiR38)

[Bayesian inference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25-PpMSrAGM&list=PLFHD4aOUZFp3Fx3rfRkBR0XjP1OCcrYXP) playlist is a good resource to learn some of the Bayesian stat basics.
